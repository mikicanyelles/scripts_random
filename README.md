# README #

Sort of different scripts written mainly in Python or Shell which are useful for QM/MM calculations using ChemShell, Turbomole and Amber.

# energy_plots.py

Takes the output of a QM/MM calculation from ChemShell (interfaced to either Turbomole or Gaussian) and plots the energies (QM/MM, QM and MM) along the optimisation of the structure or the optimisation of each point of a scan calculation.


# gantt_phd.py

Creates a Gantt Diagram using the python-gantt package.

## To-Do list
- [ ] Add saving the pngs as an option (which can be modified modifing the script)
